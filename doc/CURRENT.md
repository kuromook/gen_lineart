# Current Project State

Updated: 2026-07-25 JST

This file is the first document to read. It should contain only active state,
current decisions, and next actions. Chronological details live in
`doc/work_log.md`; reusable extraction knowledge lives in
`doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md`.

Do not read files under `archive/` directories unless the user explicitly asks
for archived history or audit material.

## Active Goal

Build a clean, non-leaky rough-to-line training/evaluation path by improving
raw manuscript pair extraction, review, masking, and dataset-specific filtering.

Old leak-era `shape1` scores are not adoption targets. Use clean eval metrics
and montage review only as current references.

## Current Data Direction

The immediate focus is raw-dataset expansion through region-matched,
variable-aspect extraction rather than same-coordinate 480px tiling.

Current ako5ver2 review target:

- `dataset/regions_ako5ver2_varregion_20260725_postalign12_masked_line_conservative/`

Current filtered ako5ver2 manifest:

- `dataset/regions_ako5ver2_varregion_20260725_postalign12_masked_line_conservative/manifest_user_review_keep281.csv`

Current ako5ver2 review status:

- source rows: 291
- excluded user-reviewed mismatches: 7
- held umbrella / mask-insufficient layer-difference rows: 3
- kept rows: 281

Important ako5ver2 review files:

- `removed_user_mismatch.csv`
- `held_user_mask_insufficient_umbrella.csv`
- `flagged_user_review_20260725.csv`
- `user_review_20260725_summary.txt`

Dataset-specific note:

- ako5ver2 has rough-only umbrella cases where rough contains an umbrella but
  the line art omits it, likely due to 3D, separate layer, or later compositing.
  These are documented in `doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md` and should
  not be trained as normal pairs under the current mask.

## Current Model Interpretation

The best recent single-model candidates remain halo-mitigation / Lucy-hint
variants, but none is a final production line-art model:

- `lucy_mild_aux_msgan`: safer balanced candidate
- `lucy_thin_aux_msgan`: higher-recall candidate requiring artifact scrutiny
- `dog_aux_msgan`: controlled white/hint candidate
- `flowdog_aux_msgan`: high-recall / high-ink expert candidate

Router/MoE oracle was useful as an upper-bound probe on clean eval, but it is
not a deployed router.

Initial line-field refiner ran successfully but overproduced ink and needs
stronger ink/width control or a revised formulation before deeper use.

## Current Extraction Rules

Use:

- `doc/EXTRACTION_RULES.md` for procedure and gates
- `doc/region_dataset_extraction_policy.md` for variable-region extraction
- `doc/region_materialization_policy.md` for manifest/materialization policy
- `doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md` for dataset-specific exceptions

Current rules to preserve:

- do not promote same-XY crops as production data without region/content
  matching
- keep candidate generation separate from acceptance
- review QC before training
- use variable-aspect manifests first where possible
- materialize fixed-size square-padded copies only when a downstream tool needs
  them
- keep layer/prop differences as hold/tag cases unless masks explicitly make
  them safe

## Documentation State

`doc/work_log.md` is approaching the 5,000-line maintenance threshold.

Use:

- `doc/documentation_maintenance_policy.md`

Current maintenance plan:

- do not automatically delete or archive `work_log.md` sections without user
  review
- create reviewable compaction proposals first
- extract reusable knowledge into focused docs
- only then archive old chronological detail

## Current Data Pipeline Stage

The 768 px long-side normalization bottleneck identified during stroke-scale
filter design has been resolved by re-materializing keep281 near native source
resolution. See `doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md` for the scale
measurement and `doc/region_dataset_extraction_policy.md` for the scale-band
and tile-score policy notes.

Current native pipeline artifacts:

- materialized regions: `dataset/regions_ako5ver2_native_20260725/` (165 of
  281 keep281 regions; 116 dropped as below 480 px native)
- masked regions: `dataset/regions_ako5ver2_native_20260725_masked_line_conservative/`
- strict tile candidates (post score cutoff):
  `results/ako5ver2_native_tiles_480_strict_cut25.csv`

A full-resolution review of the first strict pass (before the score cutoff)
found the tail contained at least one tile that passed every individual gate
but showed unrelated rough/line content. This is recorded as a standing policy
note: tile score is not a content-match guarantee, and thumbnail QC hides it.

Applying `--min-tile-score 2.5` removed that failure mode: 422 tiles from 112
regions, re-checked at full resolution with no remaining wild mismatches (only
sparse/faint tail tiles, correct semantic correspondence but loose alignment,
reviewed and accepted by the user). For scale, the earlier 768-normalized
strict subset was 90 tiles from 45 regions.

User approved proceeding to `--save` and a training pass. Saved, integrity
audit passed (0 findings), and trained
`ako5ver2_native_strict_cut25_480_warm_clean_bce_e10` (10-epoch BCE-heavy
warmstart, same recipe as prior keep281 control runs).

Result: loss decreased monotonically (0.3048 to 0.2617), but visual output
reproduces the same soft / density-map texture seen in every earlier
keep281-derived run under this recipe family. This isolates the remaining gap
to the model/recipe side, not the data pipeline: the native re-materialization
and stroke-scale tile filter are considered validated.

## 2026-07-26 Additional Native-Strict Sources: fitness, housei

Applied the same reviewed native-strict pipeline (region matching via
`match_kurip_regions.py` + strict filter via
`tools/pair_extraction/filter_matched_region_tiles.py`) to two more raw
sources, following the same "extraction methodology is validated, next work is
model-side" framing above. Goal: broaden the training pool for future
model-side experiments, not to reopen data-pipeline research.

- `fitness` (renamed from `kurip`, which was a person's username): 271 tiles
  from 37 regions, 0 integrity findings.
- `housei`: 25 tiles from 10 regions, 0 integrity findings. Small; the ceiling
  is the strict content-quality gates, not the tile-score cutoff.
- `fighting` (renamed from `lineart` earlier this session): 40 tiles, already
  recorded above.

Full details, routes, and rename rationale: `doc/dataset_status.md` and
`doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md`.

Two overnight autonomous agents were assigned `fitness` and `housei`
originally; both were lost mid-task (their transcripts became unrecoverable,
likely from an environment restart) and their work was picked up and completed
directly. This surfaced an environment issue: long-running background
extraction jobs get silently killed around 10-13 minutes regardless of
execution method, with no traceback. Recorded as a standing operational note
in `doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md`; the practical workaround is
chunked `--offset`/`--limit`/`--append` runs, now supported directly in
`filter_matched_region_tiles.py`.

Per explicit user decision, all pre-session leak-era `kurip`-named data,
checkpoints, and one-off comparison scripts were deleted outright (not
renamed) during the `fitness` rename, since that material was not needed.
5 still-active infra scripts (`match_kurip_regions.py` and 4 others) still
carry the old name; renaming those is a separate, larger decision left open
(one of them, `prepare_kurip_tiles.py`, is shared with hamlabi).

None of `fitness`/`housei`/`fighting` have been trained on yet.

## 2026-07-26 Alignment Investigation: Root-Caused To Scale/Deformation

Combined-source training (ako5ver2 native + fitness + housei + fighting, 798
tiles) surfaced a clear per-source quality gradient in output crispness
(fighting best, ako5ver2 worst) that tracked chamfer distance almost exactly.
A post-hoc `chamfer<=12` re-filter (217 tiles) did not visibly improve output
in a direct same-sample comparison against the unfiltered pool, despite the
metric correlation holding — see `doc/region_dataset_extraction_policy.md`
("Alignment Gate vs Style Gate") for the resulting architectural rule: keep
alignment gates (chamfer, strict-tolerance edge correspondence) as fixed
cross-dataset constants (`ALIGNMENT_*` in `tile_region_manifest_480.py`),
separate from style gates (ink/gray/width/black-fill), which stay per-source
tunable. `analyze_tile()` was refactored into `alignment_metrics()` +
`alignment_gate_pass()` / `style_metrics()` + `style_gate_pass()` to enforce
this structurally; regression-checked against prior saved results (identical
counts).

Root cause of why the chamfer-only refilter didn't visibly help: residual
misalignment is not just imprecise translation search. User's production-
process explanation, confirmed by test: line art is inked from a printed
rough with no production need to keep it pixel-aligned, and the finished line
art goes through a finishing pass that rescales/repositions content per panel,
per character, or occasionally a smaller partial region. A joint
translation+scale search on fitness's 5 worst-chamfer tiles cut chamfer by
25-38%, and 3 of 5 picked a non-1.0 scale — confirming real scale mismatch
that no current tool corrects for (`match_kurip_regions.py` is
translation-only; `match_hamlabi_regions.py` only tries a few discrete global
scales per parent region, not per-panel/per-character).

Decided out of scope for now: local mesh-level (non-uniform) deformation —
too open-ended to model generally, revisit if a good general method appears.

Planned fix (paused, blocked on external work): panel border lines are
composited from a separate layer in the original production file and are
absent from the finished line art layer itself, so panel boundaries cannot be
recovered from the flattened rough/line images alone (a first attempt using
long-line morphology detection on a real ako5ver2 page failed, flagging
character hair as false panel borders). User will extract the panel-border
layer as its own dataset on another machine. Once available, planned staged
approach: (1) segment pages into clean single-panel regions using that layer,
(2) verify alignment per panel (translation + one uniform scale expected, no
mesh deformation, so more tractable than whole-page matching), (3) split
further into per-character regions within a panel if multiple characters are
present, re-scoring alignment per character with only low-scoring cases
needing manual review, (4) defer finer sub-character regions, which may have
irregular/"special" deformation. Full detail:
`doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md` ("Residual Misalignment").

## Next Actions

1. **Blocked on external work**: panel-border-layer extraction (another
   machine, user-side). Resume the panel-boundary-first region segmentation
   plan once that dataset is available; see
   `doc/raw_dataset_extraction_knowledge.md`.
2. Model-side: decide the next model direction using the now-broader pool
   (ako5ver2 native strict, fitness, housei, fighting) — longer training,
   non-BCE-heavy loss, or reuse of an existing halo/Lucy/cleanup candidate
   family per `doc/model_results_summary.md`. Do not attribute the earlier
   soft/density-map output to data quality alone; alignment/scale is now a
   confirmed contributing factor, not yet fixed.
3. Decide whether to rename the remaining 5 `kurip`-named infra scripts, given
   `kurip` was a username. `prepare_kurip_tiles.py` affects hamlabi too, so
   treat that one separately from the other 4.
4. Decide whether umbrella/layer-difference rows (ako5ver2) should be manually
   masked, tagged for future routing, or left held out.
5. Keep strict88, the 768-normalized keep281 tile set, and the alignment-test
   `alignfilt12` list separate from the main native tile sets. Keep fitness,
   housei, fighting, and ako5ver2-native as separate sources until a
   deliberate mixing experiment is designed (and ideally until the
   panel-based re-alignment work lands).
